To do this task you need to install Node.js first
Simply go to nodejs.org and download the last stable version
for your OS
After installing you need to add the node executables
to your path file.
Go to MyComputer->Properties->Advanced system settings->
->Environment Variables and from the "System variables" area 
find the "Path" variable -> edit it and add at the end a new entry
with the path to the node.js folder ex:
E:\Node.js\;
