Since this problem is probably gonna be hard for a lot of people to test,
I'll write some quick instructions here to help you test it, if you're having 
trouble.
The problem asks for arguments to be passed to the program in order to function,
this can be done in one of 2 ways:
1)Execute the executable compiled program from the terminal, while passing 
the arguments to it
2)From the IDE set the arguments to be passed when executing the program
This can be done by selecting the project ->rigth click -> Properties -> select the
"Run" row -> on the line "Run command" choose "..." and add the arguments after the
inputed "${OUTPUT_PATH}", each argument should be seperated by a space

The correct commands and arguments format are the following (this help is also displayed
if you try to input an incorrect command/arguments):
Slice:
-s <source file> <destination folder> <number of parts>

where source file is the file to split ex: doge.jpg,
destination of the folder is the folder in which the parts will be put and
number of parts is the number of parts you want to slice the file into

Assemble:
-a <destination folder> <name of each part>.....

where destination folder is the folder in which the assembled file will be placed
name of each part is the full name(and path compared to the folder of the program)
to each file including it's extension, all parts should be inputed seperated by space
ex. parts/Part-2.jpg where Part-2.jpg is a file in the folder "parts" which is in the folder of the 
program

and here are 2 example inputs that can be used for testing (just open a terminal
in the folder of the executable program and paste them, You can ofcourse
test the program with your own files and directory names as long as you 
keep the above mentioned formating correct)

Slice:
./05slicingfile -s doge.jpg parts 3

Assemble:
./05slicingfile -a dest parts/Part-0.jpg parts/Part-1.jpg parts/Part-2.jpg
